## Infinity Scroll

Welcome to the **Infinity Scroll** project!
This project demonstrates the implementation of an infinite scrolling feature commonly seen on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.
The goal is to create a seamless user experience where the user never reaches the end of the content while scrolling.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: Provides the foundational structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Handles the visual appearance and styling of the elements.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the functionality, including fetching data from an API and manipulating the DOM to display the images.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: As you scroll down the page, more images are loaded automatically, giving the illusion of a never-ending feed.
- **Fetch API**: Utilizes the `fetch` method within an async function to call an API and retrieve a list of images in JSON format.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Processes the JSON data and dynamically updates the webpage to display the images.

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Data**: An asynchronous function is used to fetch data from a specified API endpoint. This function waits for the response and then processes the JSON data.
2. **Displaying Images**: The fetched image data is used to create image elements, which are then appended to the DOM, allowing the images to be displayed on the webpage.
3. **Infinite Scroll Logic**: JavaScript is used to detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page. When this occurs, the fetch function is called again to load more images, thus creating an infinite scrolling effect.

## Conclusion

This Infinity Scroll project showcases how to create a user-friendly infinite scrolling feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and customize it to fit your needs. Enjoy the seamless scrolling experience!
